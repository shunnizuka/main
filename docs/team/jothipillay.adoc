== Pocket Project CLI Application

---

== Overview

=== About The Application
Pocket Project is a desktop application used to aid software engineering project managers in keeping track
of both employees and projects under their charge. The main mode of interaction is through the use of a Command-Line
Interface (CLI) with certain specific features accessible by mouse as well. The code is written in Java and has a GUI
created with JavaFX. General project managers can use this application as well but not all features will be necessarily
relevant.

=== Our Inspiration Behind This Project
We sought ways to improve efficiency and productivity in administrative duties faced by software engineering
project managers who are in charge of a large number of employees and projects.

=== About Our Team
This application was built my team which consisted of Daryl Tan, Jeff Gan, Lin Dehui, Shune Lei and I. We built this as
part of our Software Engineering Project Module (CS2103T), which we enrolled in during our 2nd year in NUS,
while pursuing a Bachelor of Computing in Computer Science.

== Summary Of My Contributions
=== Major Enhancement
==== Overview of feature
* In our application, a few commands involve the use of calendar dates. Examples of such
commands include the setting of deadlines to projects and the setting of dates to indicate the
completion of a particular milestone, task or project.
* I added the ability to allow the user to input dates in both a standard and flexible manner while ensuring
the integrity of the chosen date.

==== What it does
* The application will accept either a standard format or a flexible format input from the user when it
expects a date field. The application is able to differentiate without the user explicitly selecting the format that
he/she is going to input.
* The standard format allows the user to key in a date in the form of `DD/MM/YYYY`.
* The flexible format allows the user to give an input with relation to the current date.
It accepts a range of inputs which can be summarized as follows:
** The user can key in common terms such as `today`, `tomorrow` and `yesterday`, which will then
be converted to the `DD/MM/YYYY` format.
** The user can also aim to choose a date with relation to the current week. The input is as simple
`this week DAY_OF_WEEK` where the `DAY_OF_WEEK` takes an integer in the range of 1 to 7 which
corresponds to Monday to Sunday respectively. Therefore, to choose the current week's Thursday as the
target date, the user can simply key `this week 4`. Similarly users can target both the following and previous
weeks by replacing the `this` keyword with `next` and `last` respectively.
** The user can also aim to choose a date with relation to the current month. The input is as simple
`this month DAY_OF_MONTH` where the `DAY_OF_MONTH` takes an integer corresponding to the day in the
target month. Therefore, to choose the 25th of the current month as the
target date, the user can simply key `this month 25`. Similarly users can target both the following and previous
months by replacing the `this` keyword with `next` and `last` respectively.
** Once the target date in chosen, the validity and accuracy of the date is tested. Should the user target
invalid dates such as `31/04/2019`, it will be rejected as the month of April only has 30 days.
** Additionally, leap years are also taken into account when processing the validity of the date.
So, as 2020 is a leap year, `29/02/2020` is considered a valid input but `29/02/2019` will be rejected
as 2019 is not a leap year.

==== Justification
* This feature improves the product significantly because a user can be more efficient in inputting dates
that are used by multiple commands. (to be edited)

==== Highlights
* This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth
analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

=== Minor Enhancement 1
==== Overview of feature
* I programmed the ability to add an employee or project to the Pocket Project application.
containing certain personal details such as
phone, email and add a project containing information such as client and deadline to the entire application. Such
commands created the foundations for the rest of the application and took the format of `add employee ...` and `add
project...`
* I implemented the base ability and foundation for various components to be added
into a project through the `addto PROJ_NAME ...` command. I created the capability for
employees and milestones to be added to a particular project and the base `addto` command
was further used by my fellow team mates who programmed the ability to add tasks and user stories
to a particular project.

==== What it does
* This feature allows the storage of employees in the application itself. Focusing, on the adding
of employees, it also allows certain key personal details to be keyed in such as an employee's phone, email and GitHub account. Such details,
although trivial at first glance, is useful in helping the manager in certain administrative procedures, especially
when the manager needs to contact an employee or perhaps review his/her work on their GitHub account.
* Similarly, this feature also allows the storage of projects in the application itself. When initially creating
a project, the user has to also input key details such as the name of the project, the client that the project is done
for and the deadline of the project. The project is also set up with a default description that can be edited afterwards.
I then implemented the ability to add employees and key milestones into the project. A milestone is a key target indicator
that segments our project lifeline into the different stages of production

==== Example usage scenarios
====== Add an employee or project to the application: `add`

* Adds an employee to the list of employees.

** Format: `add employee n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL g/GITHUB [s/SKILL]...`

* Examples:

** `add employee n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
** `add employee n/Betsy Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 s/HTML`

|===
|image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]|An employee can have any number of skills (including 0).
|===

* Adds a project to the list of projects.

** Format: `add project n/NAME d/DEADLINE c/CLIENT_NAME`

* Examples:

** `add project n/Apollo d/12/12/2019 c/FairPrice`
** `add project n/Xtreme c/John Smith d/13/04/2020`

|===
|image:ug-lightbulb.png[width="50"]|Users can simply use 'e' as an alias for 'employee' and 'p' as an alias for 'project'
while keying in a command into the CLI.
|===

====== Add an employee/milestone to a project : `addto`

==== Add an employee to a project: `addto employee`

* Adds an employee to a project.

** Format: `addto PROJECT_NAME employee EMPLOYEE_INDEX`

|===
|image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]|Adds the employee at the specified `INDEX`.
The index refers to the index number (one-based) shown in the displayed list of employees.
|===

|===
|image:ug-exclamation.png[width="50"]|The index must be a *positive integer* and cannot be larger than the size of the list.
|===

* Examples:

** `list employees` +
`addto Apollo employee 2` +
Adds the 2nd person in the displayed employee list to project "Apollo".

** `find employee John Han` +
`addto Apollo employee 5` +
Adds the 5th person in the displayed employee list to project "Apollo".

==== Add a milestone to a project: `addto milestone`

* Adds a milestone to a project.

** Format: `addto PROJECT_NAME milestone MS_DETAILS MS_DATE`

|===
|image:ug-exclamation.png[width="50"]| Date must be of the format DD/MM/YYYY (To be edited)
|===

* Examples:

** `addto Apollo milestone Completed UI for program 23/11/2015` +
Milestone added to project "Apollo".

|===
|image:ug-lightbulb.png[width="50"]|Users can simply use 'e' as an alias for 'employee' and 'p' as an alias for 'project'
while keying in a command into the CLI.
